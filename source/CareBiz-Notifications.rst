Notifications
=============

In a chat, several events can happen. For example, someone may :ref:`add you to their contacts list <reference to Adding a Contact>` and would like to 
know your presence status and thus be able to see whether you are online. Such events are listed at the bottom 
right with the pending event count on a black background.

When your chat tab or window is not active, most browsers now offer the ability to notify you through the 
operating system, often with a message appearing in one of the screen corners. This allows you to 
continue your work while being able to immediately respond to incoming requests or messages.

To prevent abuse, web pages by default do not have the right to pop up such notification messages. On 
the first message Carebiz receives while inactive, it will ask you whether it should notify you about 
background activity in the future. The browser will ask for your confirmation.

In the event that you refuse giving permission, you can :ref:`turn it on again later without the website's prompt! <reference to turning on Notifications>`.

.. As of now the notification needs to be manually activated without any prompting from the website. 
   This can be done by selecting the 'View Site Setting Icon' in the browser bar, and changing the Notifications option to 'Allow'
