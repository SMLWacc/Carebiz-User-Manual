General Information
===================

.. _reference to General Information:

.. :ref:`XMPP <reference to XMPP>`, the protocol used by CareBiz, identifies every user by a :ref:`JID <reference to JID>`.
   This JID has the same format as an email address: a local part (typically user name) and a domain name, seperated by @. The advantage of this
   notation is that organizations providing both email (typically asynchonous) and XMPP (typically 
   synchronous) communication, can provide **both services with one mnemonic ID.** This allows for integrated
   and unified communication, where a single ID can be used for email, instant messaging, and audio/video
   communications; thus alleviating the need for users to remember multiple IDs, such as (non-mnemonic) 
   telephone numbers, video conference IDs, and so on.

.. Even though both XMPP and email use the same address format, they are distinct services, not unlike fax, 
   text messages (SMS), and voice telephony using a single telephone number format, even though the 
   services differ in what they exchange, the protocol, and the typical uses.

.. Unlike proprietary instant messaging services, XMPP allows anyone operating a domain and a server to 
   provide XMPP service for its users. XMPP was designed from the start to allow these servers to easily 
   interoperate, making it easy for userA@serverA to communicate with userB@serverB, as if they were on 
   the same server. This federated design enables privacy from the start, there is no central authority which 
   knows what you are doing when and who your friends are. Only servers with a need to know (because 
   they host an account for one of your friends) will ever know anything about you; third parties remain ignorant.
